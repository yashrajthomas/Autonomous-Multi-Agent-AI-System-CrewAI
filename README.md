# Autonomous Multi-Agent AI System (CrewAI)

An end-to-end Autonomous Multi-Agent AI System built using the CrewAI framework, where multiple specialized AI agents collaborate, communicate, and execute tasks independently with minimal human intervention.

This project demonstrates how Agentic AI can be engineered to split a complex problem into multiple sub-tasks, delegate them to role-based agents, share information among agents, and produce a refined final output.
